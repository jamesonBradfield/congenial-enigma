# pros
- cooler aesthetic. I could use hyprland
- smoother games.
- could jump into glsl shaders for desktop customization.
- could customize from the start for what works for me and throw out other stuff.
- would have progress bar for terminal

# cons
- would take a long time to setup how I like. (4 hours for a basic setup), plus another 5 to reinstall games.
- wouldn't fix my internet issues.
- wouldn't debloat my current distro.
- my knowledge would be useless
- i would have to ditch my i3 config.
- I would need another polybar.

 I won't switch to wayland unless I am sure I have a quick startup.
