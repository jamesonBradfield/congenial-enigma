Word vomit
Honestly this past month has been rough, I am conflicted between all the shit i am juggling (Job coaches/ applying to new jobs, my almost full time job slinging packages, school and trying to over accomplish) it's all just a bit much.

but there is a light at the end of the tunnel, if I am successful in sticking with even one of these things I will be in a better place than I am currently.

What really is pissing me off is that I feel like I am getting nowhere on my job hunt and it's all my fault. I could care less if I'm slacking at work or falling behind in school. Because ultimately both of those are just means to the end of getting a office job.

Finally I am super thankful for my sister and my family, this transitional period would be much harder without their support and I really appreciate that they are willing to help and see me as worth the time and effort invested.

My goal tomorrow is to do a great job at work, work hard sweat a lot, apply to 4 jobs, and finish editing together my video resume. (If I'm ambitious I can finish my science project rough draft).
