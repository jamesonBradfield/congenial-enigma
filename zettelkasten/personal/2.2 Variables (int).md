A variable declaration is a statement that declares a new variable, specifying the variable's name and type. Ex: int userAge; declares a new variable named userAge that can hold an integer value. The compiler allocates a memory location for userAge capable of storing an integer. Allocation is the process of determining a suitable memory location to store data like variables. Ex: In the animation below, the compiler has given userAge memory location 97, which is known as the variable's address. The choice of 97 is arbitrary and irrelevant to the programmer, but the idea that a variable corresponds to a memory location is important to understand.

When a statement that assigns a variable with a value executes, the processor writes the value into the variable's memory location. Likewise, reading a variable's value reads the value from the variable's memory location. The programmer must declare a variable before any statement that assigns or reads the variable, so that the variable's memory location is known.

An assignment statement assigns the variable on the left-side of the = with the current value of the right-side expression. Ex: numApples = 8; assigns numApples with the value of the right-side expression (in this case 8). assign

An expression may be a number like 80, a variable name like numApples, or a simple calculation like numApples + 1. Simple calculations can involve standard math operators like +, -, and *, and parentheses as in 2 * (numApples - 1). An integer like 80 appearing in an expression is known as an integer literal.

> [!TIP]
> ## Initializing variables
> Although not required, an integer variable is often assigned an initial value when declared.
> ```java
> // declare maxSize with value of 100
> int maxSize = 100;
> 
> ```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AgePrinter {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int avgLifespan = 70;
      int userAge;

      System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
      userAge = scnr.nextInt();

      System.out.println(userAge + " is a great age");
      System.out.println("Average lifespan is " + avgLifespan);
   }
}

> [!QUESTION]
> Write one statement that declares an integer variable numHouses initialized to 25.
> ```java
> import java.util.Scanner;
> 
> public class DeclaringVariables {
>    public static void main(String[] args) {
> 
>       /* Your solution goes here  */
>       int numHouses = 25;
>       System.out.println(numHouses);

> [!TIP]
> Assignment statement with same variable on both sides
> Commonly, a variable appears on both the right and left side of the = operator.
> ```java
>     numItems == 5;
>     numItems = numItems + 1;
>     numItems == 6
> ```
> The statement reads the value of numItems (5), adds 1, and assigns numItems with the result of 6, which replaces the value previously held in numItems.

> [!QUESTION]
> Write a statement that increases numPeople by 5. Ex: If numPeople is initially 10, the output is: There are 15 people.

>       int numPeople;

>       /* Your solution goes here  */
>       // technically shouldn't pass yet, but I'm lazy
>       numPeople += 5;
>       System.out.print("There are ");
